  abstract = {Support vector machines (SVM) is a widely used machine learning algorithm. With the increasing amount of research data nowadays, understanding how to do efficient training is more important than ever. This article discusses the performance optimizations and benchmarks related to providing high-performance support for SVM training. In this research, we have focused on a highly scalable gradient descent-based approach to implementing the core SVM algorithm. In providing a scalable solution, we have designed optimized high-performance computing and dataflow-oriented SVM implementations. A high-performance computing approach means the algorithm is implemented with the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model. In addition, we analyzed the language level optimizations and math kernel optimizations on a prominent HPC modeling programming language (C++) and dataflow modeling programming language (Java). In the experiments, we compared the performance of classic HPC models, classic dataflow models, and hybrid models designed on classic HPC and dataflow programming models. Our research illustrates a scientific approach in designing the SVM algorithm at scale in classic HPC, dataflow, and hybrid systems.},

  abstract = {There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

The first part of the paper is devoted to overview the fifth-generation of cellular networks, explaining its requirements as well as its key technologies, their challenges and its forthcoming architecture. The second part is devoted to present a basic overview of ML techniques that are nowadays applied to cellular networks. The last part discusses the most important related works which propose ML solutions in order to overcome 5G challenges.},

  abstract = {We formulate a probabilistic framework for simultaneous region-based 2D segmentation and 2D to 3D pose tracking, using a known 3D model. Given such a model, we aim to maximise the discrimination between statistical foreground and background appearance models, via direct optimisation of the 3D pose parameters. The foreground region is delineated by the zero-level-set of a signed distance embedding function, and we define an energy over this region and its immediate background surroundings based on pixel-wise posterior membership probabilities (as opposed to likelihoods). We derive the differentials of this energy with respect to the pose parameters of the 3D object, meaning we can conduct a search for the correct pose using standard gradient-based non-linear minimisation techniques. We propose novel enhancements at the pixel level based on temporal consistency and improved online appearance model adaptation. Furthermore, straightforward extensions of our method lead to multi-camera and multi-object tracking as part of the same framework. The parallel nature of much of the processing in our algorithm means it is amenable to GPU acceleration, and we give details of our real-time implementation, which we use to generate experimental results on both real and artificial video sequences, with a number of 3D models. These experiments demonstrate the benefit of using pixel-wise posteriors rather than likelihoods, and showcase the qualities, such as robustness to occlusions and motion blur (and also some failure modes), of our tracker.},

The values of the latent variables in the deepest layer are easy to infer and give a much better representation of each document than Latent Semantic Analysis. When the deepest layer is forced to use a small number of binary variables (e.g. 32), the graphical model performs ``semantic hashing'': Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. This way of extending the efficiency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster than locality sensitive hashing, which is the fastest current method. By using semantic hashing to filter the documents given to TF-IDF, we achieve higher accuracy than applying TF-IDF to the entire document set.},
